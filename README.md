# dotfiles

My work in progress dotfile repo, based on https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789 and https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/

## Installing
Use `install` to symlink everything into place. It's actually [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

## Secrets & Mac specific
As suggested by Dotbot, these are kept in a different repo. Files in this repo have override code to handle the override files if they are present.
